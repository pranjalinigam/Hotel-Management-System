## 🔍 Logic & Workflow
1. User navigates through menu options like **Home**, **Prices**, **Gallery**, **Dining**, and **Contact**.  
2. The **Create New Booking** form takes guest details, check-in/check-out dates, and room type.  
3. JavaScript captures and validates user input.  
4. Bookings are dynamically displayed in the **Current Bookings** section without page reload.  
5. All updates are handled on the client side using DOM manipulation.
